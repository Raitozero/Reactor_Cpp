Reactor_Cpp

This project involves building a custom Reactor server, the core model behind renowned frameworks like Redis, Nginx, and RPC. 
The goal is to master high-performance, scalable framework design, while enhancing proficiency in C++ network programming, threading, smart pointers, and advanced C++11 techniques. 
By constructing this network library from scratch (akin to Muduo, without relying on third-party libraries such as libevent), the project aims to pave the way for developing large-scale applications with millions of users.
